# Quiz-game-in-C
This program asks the user multiple-choice questions and tracks their score based on their answers.
This quiz game consists of five questions. You can add more questions or modify the existing ones by editing the questions, options, and correctOptions arrays. Each question has four options (A, B, C, D), and the user is prompted to enter the correct option. The program then checks the user's answer, updates the score, and provides feedback on whether the answer was correct or not. Finally, the program displays the user's total score.
